    "# Technique G213: Provide conventional controls and an application setting for motion activated input\n\n## About this Technique\n\nThis technique relates to [2.5.4: Motion Actuation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/motion-actuation) (Sufficient).\n\nThis technique applies to web pages that detect device or user motion such as shaking or tilting and use this motion as a means of input. If the motion itself is essential to the application's function, then this technique does not apply.\n\nThis technique also does not relate to movement of users through space as registered by geolocation sensors or beacons, or events observed by the device other than intentional gesturing by the user. It also does not cover indirect motion associated with operating a keyboard, pointer, or assistive technology.\n\n## Description\n\nThe objective of this technique is to ensure that:\n\n1. People who use mounted devices or who cannot precisely manipulate a device are able to provide inputs through more conventional user interface components, and\n2. People who may accidentally activate sensors due to tremors or other motor impairments have the ability to turn off motion actuation to prevent such accidental triggering of functions.\n\nWhen a device sensor such as an accelerometer or gyroscope is used to gather input:\n\n1. A button, link, or other conventional control is provided that does not rely on sensor input, and\n2. A setting is provided to allow the user to turn off the sensor data.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Shake to undo\n\nAfter text is entered in a field, shaking a device shows a dialog offering users to undo the entry. Supporting use of the backspace key and/or providing a clear button next to the text field offers the same functionality.\n\nShake to undo can be turned off in a settings page.\n\n### Example 2: Motion Activated Slider\n\nA slider can be adjusted by tipping the device to the left and right. There are also buttons to achieve the same functionality, and a tick-box that prevents the motion from having an effect.\n\nWorking example of a [slider with motion actuation](../../working-examples/device-motion-sensor-input/).\n\n## Tests\n\n### Procedure\n\nFor each input that performs a function in response to a motion sensor:\n\n1. Check that there is a mechanism to perform the same function that does not rely on a sensor.\n2. Check that there is a user setting which disables the motion detection.\n\n### Expected Results\n\n* Check #1 and #2 are true.\n",
    "# Technique G178: Providing controls on the web page that allow users to incrementally change the size of all text on the page up to 200 percent\n\n## About this Technique\n\nThis technique relates to [1.4.4: Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text) (Sufficient).\n\nThis technique applies to all technologies.\n\n## Description\n\nThe purpose of this technique is to provide a mechanism on the web page to incrementally increase the size of text. Many people with low vision do not use magnifying software, and they may not be familiar with their browser's text size adjustments. This may be particularly true of older people who are learning about computers later in life and who may be experiencing age related vision loss. It may also be true of some people with cognitive disabilities who require increased font size.\n\nThis technique provides a mechanism that some users will find easier to use. The mechanism may include links or buttons that will switch the visual presentation to a different style sheet or use scripts to change the text size dynamically.\n\nTo implement this technique, an author provides controls that allow the user to incrementally increase or decrease the text size of all of the text on the page to a size up to 200% of the default text size.\n\nThis can be achieved by providing links, buttons or linked images and the controls themselves should be as easy to find (e.g. prominently positioned within the page, presented in a larger text size, high contrast, etc.) as possible.\n\nThis technique can also be used in circumstances where scalable fonts cannot be used, such as legacy code situations.\n\nNote\n\nThis technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present a page that is a [conforming alternate version](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-conforming-alternate-versions) for non-conforming content. Refer to [C29: Using a style switcher to provide a conforming alternate version](../css/C29) and [Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#conforming-alt-versions) for more information.\n\n## Examples\n\n* A newspaper article has two buttons near the top of the page. The \"increase text size\" button has a big letter \"T\" with an upward arrow and the \"decrease text size\" button has a small letter \"T\" with a down arrow. There is alt text on each button.\n* A site has a number of style sheets with different text size. The user can choose any of the style sheets if their browser provides this functionality. Each page also includes the links \"Increase text size\" and \"Decrease text size\" that will change the style sheet currently applied to the appropriate alternate style sheet.\n* A site includes the text \"Change text size:\" followed by text links \"Up\" and \"Down\" on every web page. The links trigger a Javascript that alters the value of the text-size property accordingly.\n* A site includes a link on every page that reads \"Change text size.\" The resulting page includes a series of links that includes options representing the available sizes. The links read, \"Smallest font size,\" \"Small font size,\" \"Default font size,\" \"Large font size,\" etc. Instructions preceding the list direct users to choose a link to change to the desired font size.\n\n## Tests\n\n### Procedure\n\n1. Set the viewport size to 1024px by 768px or larger.\n2. Increase the text size and check to see if the text size increased.\n3. Check that the text size can be increased to 200% of the original size.\n4. Check that after increasing the text size to 200% of the original size, there is no loss of content or functionality (e.g. no parts of the text are clipped, boxes do not overlap, controls are not obscured or separated from their labels, etc.).\n5. Decrease the text size to its default value and check to see if it in fact returned to the default size.\n\n### Expected Results\n\n* Checks #2, #3, #4 and #5 are true.\n",
    "# Technique F108: Failure of Success Criterion 2.5.7 Dragging Movements due to not providing a single pointer method that does not require a dragging movement\n\n## About this Technique\n\nThis technique relates to [2.5.7: Dragging Movements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/dragging-movements) (Failure).\n\nThis failure applies to content using any technology which supports pointer input.\n\n## Description\n\nThe objective of this failure is to avoid situations in which people with motor impairments who cannot operate content because the only way to actuate a function is by dragging a target element from its initial position to some other position. The failure occurs when there is no alternative single pointer input available to actuate the function. The alternative may involve a series of single pointer interactions (for example, activating a target to be moved; opening a dropdown menu; and selecting a drop destination from the list of menu items offered).\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: List re-ordering\n\nA list of items can be re-ordered by picking up an item and dragging it upwards or downwards. Other elements move dynamically to open a gap where the picked-up target can be dropped. There is no alternative way to re-order the list that can be executed via a [single pointer](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-single-pointer) input.\n\n### Example 2: Kanban board\n\nIn a Kanban implementation for process management, tasks can be dragged horizontally across from one \u2018swimming lane\u2019 to another in order to change the status of tasks (for example, to change the status of a task from \u201cin process\u201d to \u201ccompleted\u201d). There is no alternative way to move targets between lanes that can be executed via a [single pointer](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-single-pointer) input.\n\n## Tests\n\n### Procedure\n\n1. Check the interface for the presence of functions triggered by [dragging movements](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-dragging-movements)\n2. Check that there is a [single pointer](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-single-pointer) input alternative to operate the same function\n\n### Expected Results\n\n* If #2 is false, then this failure condition applies and the content fails this Success Criterion.\n",
    "# Technique F106: Failure due to inability to deactivate motion actuation\n\n## About this Technique\n\nThis technique relates to [2.5.4: Motion Actuation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/motion-actuation) (Failure).\n\nThis failure applies to content using technologies that can support the detection of device or user motion such as shaking or tilting and use these motions as a means of input.\n\n## Description\n\nThis describes the failure condition that results when motion actuation can not be deactivated. People who may accidentally activate sensors due to tremors or other motor impairments need the ability to turn off motion actuation to prevent such accidental triggering of functions.\n\nNote\n\nThe type of motion covered by the [Motion Actuation Success Criterion](motion-actuation) does not relate to the movement of users through space as registered by geolocation sensors or beacons, or events observed by the device other than intentional gesturing by the user. It also does not cover indirect motion associated with operating a keyboard, pointer, or assistive technology.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Motion Activated Slider\n\nA slider which uses tilting motion to increase or decrease the value of an input, with no mechanism to deactivate the motion detection.\n\n[Working example of a motion activated slider that can not be deactivated](../../working-examples/device-motion-sensor-input-failure/)\n\n## Related Techniques\n\n* [G213: Provide conventional controls and an application setting for motion activated input](../general/G213)\n\n## Tests\n\n### Procedure\n\nFor each function that is triggered by a motion sensor:\n\n1. Check if the use of a motion sensor is essential or required to make the function accessibility supported.\n2. Check if there is a user setting which disables the motion detection.\n\n### Expected Results\n\n* If #1 and 2 are false then the control fails this success criterion.\n",
    "# Technique F54: Failure of Success Criterion 2.1.1 due to using only pointing-device-specific event\n                    handlers (including gesture) for a function\n\n## About this Technique\n\nThis technique relates to [2.1.1: Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard) (Failure).\n\nThis failure applies to technologies that have event handlers specific to pointing devices.\n\n## Description\n\nWhen pointing device-specific event handlers are the only mechanism available to invoke a function of the content, users with no vision (who cannot use devices such as mice that require eye-hand coordination) as well as users who must use alternate keyboards or input devices that act as keyboard emulators will be unable to access the function of the content.\n\nFor Success Criterion 2.1.1 there is an exception for functions that require a path-dependant pointer movement.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: An image that responds to a mouse click to go to another page\n\nThis is a failure because the keyboard cannot be used to move to the next page.\n\n```html\n<p><img onmousedown=\"nextPage();\" src=\"nextarrow.gif\" alt=\"Go to next page\"></p>\n```\n\n## Related Techniques\n\n* [SCR20: Using both keyboard and other device-specific functions](../client-side-script/SCR20)\n\n## Tests\n\n### Procedure\n\n1.

    "# Technique SCR39: Making content on focus or hover hoverable, dismissible, and persistent\n\n## About this Technique\n\nThis technique relates to [1.4.13: Content on Hover or Focus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/content-on-hover-or-focus) (Sufficient).\n\nThis technique applies to any technology that supports the display of additional content on pointer hover.\n\n## Description\n\nAdditional content that is displayed when a user moves the pointer over a trigger or moves the keyboard focus to the trigger (for example, a pop-up) must remain visible to allow users time to read and interact with the content and must allow the user to move the pointer over the additional content.\n\nLow vision users who magnify their screens often see only a small part of the screen at a time (their viewport). This means that the additional content may not be fully visible in the current viewport and users may need to move their mouse over the additional content to read it. web authors should therefore ensue that additional content stays visible when the pointer moves away from the trigger to the (mostly adjacent) additional content. additional content should also be dismissible without moving the focus, so that users can read content covered by the additional content.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Content preview for links\n\nWhen hovering over or focusing on a link, a content preview for the link appears just above or below that link. Users can move the pointer over the additional content (pop-up) so that they can fully read the additional content. Pressing the Esc key dismisses (closes) the additional content.\n\n#### HTML of example 1\n\n```html\n<p>This is the \n   <a class=\"a-and-tooltip\" id=\"parent\" href=\"index.html\">trigger\n   <span id=\"popup\" role=\"tooltip\">And this additional text \n    gives additional context on the trigger term\n   </span>\n  </a>.\n   Text and popup are <strong>in one link (a)</strong> element.\n</p>\n```\n\n#### CSS of example 1\n\n```css\n[role=\"tooltip\"] {\n  display: none;\n  padding: 0.5em;\n  background:white;\n  color: black;\n  border:solid black 2px;\n  width:10em;\n}\n\n.a-and-tooltip {\n  position: relative;\n}\n\n[role=\"tooltip\"] {\n  position: absolute;\n  left:0;\n  top:1em;\n}\n```\n\n#### JavaScript of example 1\n\n```javascript\n// trigger and popup inside the same link\n\nvar parent = document.getElementById(\"parent\");\n\nparent.onmouseover = function() {\n  document.getElementById(\"popup\").style.display = \"block\";\n}\n\nparent.onmouseout = function() {\n  document.getElementById(\"popup\").style.display = \"none\";\n}\n\nparent.onfocus = function() {\n  document.getElementById(\"popup\").style.display = \"block\";\n}\n\nparent.onblur = function() {\n  document.getElementById(\"popup\").style.display = \"none\";\n}\n\n// hide when ESC is pressed\n\ndocument.addEventListener(\"keydown\", (e) => {\n  if ((e.keyCode || e.which) === 27)\n    document.getElementById(\"popup\").style.display = \"none\";\n});\n```\n\n[Working example of content on hover or focus](../../working-examples/script-hoverable/)\n\n## Tests\n\n### Procedure\n\nFor additional content that appears on hover check that:\n\n1. The pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing.\n2. The additional content stays visible and does not automatically close after a time.\n3. The content can be closed without moving the pointer way from the trigger. Either by pressing Esc, by pressing another documented keyboard shortcut, or by activating the trigger.\n\nFor additional content that appears on focus check that:\n\n1. The additional content stays visible and does not automatically close after a time.\n2. The content can be closed without moving the focus way from the trigger. Either by pressing Esc, by pressing another other documented keyboard shortcut, or by activating the trigger.\n\n### Expected Results\n\nFor content that appears on hover:\n\n* #1, #2 and #3 are true.\n\nFor content that appears on focus:\n\n* #1 and #2 are true.\n",
    "# Technique F83: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.3 and 1.4.6 due to using background images that do not provide sufficient contrast with foreground text (or images of text)\n\n## About this Technique\n\nThis technique relates to:\n\n* [1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum) (Failure)\n* [1.4.6: Contrast (Enhanced)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-enhanced) (Failure)\n\nThis failure applies to any technology.\n\n## Description\n\nThis failure occurs when people with low vision are not able to read text that is displayed over a background image. When there is not sufficient contrast between the background image and the text, features of the background image can be confused with the text making it difficult to accurately read the text.\n\nTo satisfy Success Criterion 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, there must be sufficient contrast between the text and its background. For pictures, this means that there would need to be sufficient contrast between the text and those parts of the image that are most like the text and behind the text.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Failure Example 1\n\nBlack text overlays an image with black lines. The lines cross behind the letters making F's look like E's etc.\n\n### Failure Example 2\n\nBlack text overlays an image with dark gray areas. Wherever the text crosses a dark gray area the contrast is so bad that the text cannot be read.\n\n## Tests\n\n### Procedure\n\n1. Quickcheck: First do a quick check to see if the contrast between the text and the area of the image that is darkest (for dark text) or lightest (for light text) meets or exceeds that required by the Success Criterion (1.4.3 or 1.4.5). If the contrast meets or exceeds the specified contrast, then there is no failure.\n2. If the Quickcheck is false, then check to see if the background behind each letter has sufficient contrast with the letter.\n\n### Expected Results\n\n* If Quickcheck is false and #2 is false as well then this failure condition applies and the content fails the contrast Success Criterion.\n",
    "# Technique F24: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.3, 1.4.6 and 1.4.8 due to specifying foreground colors without\n      specifying background colors or vice versa\n\n## About this Technique\n\nThis technique relates to:\n\n* [1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum) (Failure)\n* [1.4.6: Contrast (Enhanced)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-enhanced) (Failure)\n* [1.4.8: Visual Presentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/visual-presentation) (Failure)\n\nThis failure applies to all technologies that allow user agents to control foreground and background colors through personal stylesheets or other means.\n\n## Description\n\nUsers with vision loss or cognitive, language and learning challenges often prefer specific foreground and background color combinations. In some cases, individuals with low vision will find it much easier to see a web page that has white text on a black background, and they may have set their user agent to present this contrast. Many user agents make it possible for users to choose a preference about the foreground or background colors they would like to see without overriding all author-specified styles. This makes it possible for users to view pages where colors have not been specified by the author in their preferred color combination.\n\nUnless an author specifies both foreground and background colors, then they (the author) can no longer guarantee that the user will get a contrast that meets the contrast requirements. If, for example, the author specifies, that text should be grey, then it may override the settings of the user agent and render a page that has grey text (specified by the author) on a light grey background (that was set by the user in their user agent). This principle also works in reverse. If the author forces the background to be white, then the white background specified by the author could be similar in color to the text color preference expressed by the user in their user agent settings, thus rendering the page unusable to the user. Because an author can not predict how a user may have configured their preferences, if the author specifies a foreground text color then they should also specify a background color which has sufficient contrast with the foreground and vice versa.\n\nIt is not necessary that the foreground and background colors both be defined on the same CSS rule. Since CSS color properties inherit from ancestor elements, it is sufficient if both foreground and background colors are defined either directly or through inheritance by the time that color is applied to a given element.\n\nNote\n\nBest practice is to include all states of the text. For example, text, link text, visited link text, link text with hover and keyboard focus, etc.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Specifying only background color with CSS\n\nIn the example below the background color is defined on the CSS stylesheet, however the foreground color is not defined. Therefore, the example fails the Success Criterion.\n\n```html\n<!doctype>\n  <html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <title>Setting the canvas background</title>\n    <style>\n      body {background-color:white}\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p>My background is white.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Example 2: Specifying only foreground color with CSS\n\nIn the example below the foreground color is defined on the CSS stylesheet, however the background color is not defined. Therefore, the example fails the Success Criterion.\n\n```html\n<!doctype>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <title>Setting the canvas foreground</title>\n  <style>\n    body {color:white}\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <p>My foreground is white.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Example 3: Specifying foreground color of link text with CSS\n\nIn the example below the link text (foreground) color is defined on the body element. However, the background color is not defined. Therefore, the example fails the Success Criterion.\n\n```html\n<!doctype>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <title>A study of population dynamics</TITLE>\n  <style>\n    a:link { color: red }\n    a:visited { color: maroon }\n    a:active { color: fuchsia }\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n <p>... document body... <a href=\"foo.htm\">Foo</a></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Related Resources\n\nNo endorsement implied.\n\n* [CSS Cascading and Inheritance Level 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-cascade-4/)\n\n## Related Techniques\n\n* [C23: Specifying text and background colors of secondary content such as banners, features and navigation in CSS while not specifying text and background colors of the main content](../css/C23)\n* [C25: Specifying borders and layout in CSS to delineate areas of a web page while not specifying text and text-background colors](../css/C25)\n\n## Tests\n\n### Procedure\n\n1. Examine the code of the web page.\n2. Check to see if an author-specified foreground color is present\n3. Check to see if an author-specified background color is present\n\nNote\n\nColor and background color may be specified at any level in the cascade of preceding selectors, by external stylesheets or through inheritance rules.\n\nBackground color may also be specified using a background image with the CSS property 'background-image' or with the CSS property 'background' (with the URI of the image, e.g., 'background: url(\"images/bg.gif\")'). With background images, it is still necessary to specify a background color, because users may have images turned off in their browser. But the background image and the background color need to be checked.\n\n### Expected Results\n\nIf check #2 is true but step #3 is false, or if check #3 is true but step #2 is false then this failure condition applies and content fails these Success Criteria.\n",
    "# Technique G219: Ensuring that an alternative is available for dragging movement s that operate on content\n\n## About this Technique\n\nThis technique relates to [2.5.7: Dragging Movements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/dragging-movements) (Sufficient).\n\nThis technique applies to content using any technology which supports pointer input.\n\n## Description\n\nThe objective of this Technique is to ensure that people with motor impairments who cannot carry out [dragging movements](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-dragging-movements) are presented with an alternative [single pointer](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-single-pointer) interaction that does not involve dragging.\n\nSome direct manipulation interfaces allow users to pick up targets and use dragging movements to move them to another position, for example, to change the position of an item in a priority list, or to move a task on a Kanban or planning board.\n\nSuch dragging movements are difficult or impossible to carry out for some users with motor disabilities. The alternative to dragging movements operates the underlying function by one or several [single pointer](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-single-pointer) activations that don't require dragging. A single tap or click may reveal controls (arrows) to move a target in a stepwise fashion; open a drop-down menu where the drop position can be selected; or allow moving it to an adjacent postion by a swipe gesture.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1\n\n* A list of items can be re-ordered by picking up an item and dragging it upwards or downwards. Other elements move dynamically to open a gap where the picked-up target can be dropped. After a single pointer activation, the list items display up and down arrows which allow a step-wise re-ordering of the list via [single pointer](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-single-pointer) inputs (taps or clicks at the up or down arrow).\n* A vertical priority list indicates the priority of items listed. Each item can be \u2018picked up\u2019 with a pointer and dragged up or down to another position. The other list items rearrange dynamically. To the left of each list item, a number in a text field shows the current priority position. For any of the items, users can put in another number. This leads to a dynamic reordering and renumbering of the priority list.\n* In a Kanban implementation for process management, tasks can be dragged horizontally from one \u2018swimming lane\u2019 to another in order to change the status of tasks (for example, to change the status of a task from \u201cin process\u201d to \u201ccompleted\u201d). One or several items in a lane can be selected by a single tap or click. A single pointer activation of a drop-down menu labelled \u201cMove selected items to\u201d offers a selection of drop targets (other lanes). A further single pointer activation over the desired menu item moves targets to the specified lane.\n* In a radial control widget, the visual indicator of the current value of the control can be dragged to a different position. Users can also click or tap on another position of the radial control to change the value.\n\n## Related Techniques\n\n* [G215: Providing controls to achieve the same result as path based or multipoint gestures](../general/G215)\n\n## Tests\n\n### Procedure\n\nFor interface elements that support dragging:\n\n1. Check the interface for the presence of functions triggered by [dragging movement](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-dragging-movements)s.\n2. Check that there is a [single pointer](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-single-pointer) activation alternative that does not require dragging to operate the same function\n\n### Expected Results\n\n* Check #2 is true.\n\nIf this is a sufficient technique for a success criterion, failing this test procedure does not necessarily mean that the success criterion has not been satisfied in some other way, only that this technique has not been successfully implemented and cannot be used to claim conformance.\n",
